# Commit Convention

<details><summary>Click to expand..</summary>

We follow the Angular Commit Convention. This convention ensures a consistent and traceable structure for our commit messages. More information can be found here: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

Our `git-tools` already includes the implementation of this convention to ensure that all commits adhere to the standards.
